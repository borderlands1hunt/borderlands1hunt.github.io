			<t>
1. You must create new characters for use during the hunt.<br>
-All characters used must be made on or after (START TIME TBD) in order to be eligible for the leaderboards.<br>
-Items earned on separate characters are all valid for points with the exception of rule 2.<br><br>
 
2. You must stream the entirety of your hunt to qualify for leaderboards.<br>
-All of the your gameplay must be available to viewing on twitch at the time of completion. Be sure to enable past broadcasts.<br>
-If the hunt goes on for a long enough length of time your past broadcasts will be automatically deleted by twitch- make sure to highlight them to prevent deletion.<br><br>
 
3. You can only earn points once per listed item.<br>
-Finding multiple of the same item will not yield more points than listed on the checklist.<br>
-In the case of hybrids a hybrid drop will count as both the unique and legendary. However, finding a "Bone Shredder" and a "Savior" as two separate guns will not earn you points for the "Bone Shredder Savior" hybrid weapon.<br><br>
 
4. No duplicating items.<br>
-You may not abuse quitting without saving (this includes read only, alt f4 or dashboarding) in order to duplicate any items. If any items are duplicated accidentally, simply drop all but one of the duplicated items.<br><br>
 
5. Read only/dashboarding/alt f4 to quit without saving is allowed.<br>
-Some gear such as backpack SDUs and other mission rewards or farming locations such as the Circle of Duty require read only or quitting without saving. You may quit without saving for any reason other than to duplicate gear.<br><br>
 
6. Save Editors are not allowed.<br>
-Usage of Willowtree to modify your game save is not allowed. This includes expanding your backpack or modifying mission progress. If you softlock a story mission or missed backpack SDUs in previous playthroughs you may earn them on another character in compliance
with rules 1 and 2.<br><br>
 
7. No macros/external game modifications.<br>
-You may increase your FOV, bind keys or adjust your game visuals through the use of the game's config files.<br>
-You may not, however, modify your game with new guns, fast travel points or other external game modifications if you wish to qualify for the leaderboards.<br>
-You may not use programs such as Auto Hotkey or other macro software in order to perform actions in game.<br>
