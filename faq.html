<p>4. You can only earn points once per listed item.</p><br>
<t>-Finding multiple of the same item will not yield more points than listed on the checklist.<br>
-In the case of hybrids a hybrid drop will count as both the unique and legendary. However, finding a "Bone Shredder" and a "Savior" as two separate guns will not earn you points for the "Bone Shredder Savior" hybrid weapon.</t><br><br>
 
<p>5. Unique weapons must be farmed from enemies, with exceptions.</p>
<t>-Athena's Wisdom and Chiquito Amigo can only be recieved as mission rewards and are worth points.<br>

<p>7. No duplicating items.</p><br>
<t>-You may not abuse quitting without saving (this includes read only, alt f4 or dashboarding) in order to duplicate any items. If any items are duplicated accidentally, simply drop all but one of the duplicated items.</t><br><br>
 
<p>8. Read only/dashboarding/alt f4 to quit without saving is allowed.</p><br>

<h1>FAQ</h1><br><br>
 
<p>What is the BL1 Loot Hunt?</p><br>
<t>-The Borderlands 1 Loot Hunt is a community race to see who can collect the most loot!</t><br><br>
 
<p>Is there a Prize for winning?</p><br>
<t>-First, second and third place will each win a Hero Hoodie of their choosing from <a href="https://drunkmunk.com/collections/hero-hoodies-borderlands" target="_blank">https://drunkmunk.com/collections/hero-hoodies-borderlands</a><br>
*If hoodies are unavailable for purchase you can also choose to recieve the cash value of a hero hoodie through paypal.<br>
-The Borderlands 1 Loot Hunt is in no way sponsored by or affailiated with drunk munk. They make cool hoodies, though.</t><br><br>
 
<p>How long will the BL1 Loot Hunt be?</p><br>
<t>-The Borderlands 1 Loot Hunt will last for exactly two weeks (fourteen days) after the start date.</t><br><br>
 
<p>Is the BL1 Loot Hunt affiliated with Guardiancon or Gearbox?</p><br>
<t>-No.</t><br>
 
<p>Do I have to stream to do the BL1 Loot Hunt?</p><br>
<t>-Streaming is only required if you want to be placed on the leaderboard. If you just want to use the checklist and have fun farming loot without streaming you can absolutely do so. Under "Are you competing?" on the registration form, select "No".</t><br><br>
 
<p>How do I earn points for my drops?</p><br>
<t>-When you have an item on the checklist drop in the game, use twitch to create a clip of the drop happening and enter the clip's URL into your own personal checklist.<br>
-Try to include the drop itself happening and not just a short video showing loot on the ground. Makes scoring easier.</t><br><br>
 
<p>Which character should I play? Which is the best?</p><br>
<t>-Whichever character you want! Every character has their own unique pros and cons for both solo and co-op play. Don't pick a character based on what other people tell you is best- feel free to try something new. If you don't like your choice, you can always make a new character!</t><br><br>
 
<p>What does "read only" mean? How do I do it?</p><br>
<t>-Read only farming is the act of setting your borderlands save file to "read only" to prevent your game from saving. This lets you recieve mission rewards multiple times or play through one-time events multiple times. You can also quit without saving by using dashboard on console or alt+f4 on PC.<br>
-Some items require you to quit without saving to farm. These include certain Backpack SDUs (more info below), Circle of Duty rewards, King Wee-Wee's Spy SMG and the Spectre class mod for lilith.</t><br><br>
 
<p>Why are backpack SDUs on the checklist?</p><br>
<t>-Certain Backpack SDUs are only available as a rare reward from their respective claptrap rescue mission. These include the Lockdown Palace rescue mission in playthrough 1 as well as the Sledge's Safe House, Lost Cave, New Haven, Tetanus Warren and Earl's Scrapyard rescue missions in playthrough 2.<br>
-Mad Moxxi's mission "Prove Yourself" awards the player with an extra skill point through a "Skill Point SDU", once per playthrough.<br>
-Additionally, it would be unfortunate if people felt the need to skip claptrap rescue missions in order to get to other farms faster. Nobody should be restricted to 39 backpack slots in a game with 87 bazillion guns.</t><br><br>
 
<p>There are legendary eridian weapons? How do I get them?</p><br>
<t>-Legendary eridian weapons are only available as exceedingly rare drops from lance units in the General Knoxx DLC. They are among the rarest guns in the borderlands franchise. You may want to wait until after you've gotten most of the other loot before trying to acquire these.<br>
-If you wish to farm lance units for a chance at a legendary eridian weapon, your best bet is farming the Circle of Duty. They can also rarely be found in lance chests.</t><br><br>
 
<p>What are hybrid weapons? Where do you find them?</p><br>
<t>-Hybrid weapons are guns that have the effects of two separate unique weapons. The TK's Wave Bulldog has both the 20 round drum and increased reload speed of the bulldog with the wave firing style of the TK's Wave.<br>
-Hybrid weapons are exceedingly rare and can only be farmed where the unique part of the weapon drops normally.</t>
